Hello!
If you're reading this file, you're using Xavier and Tom's RabbitMQ middle-ware solution -- good luck, you'll need to follow these next steps carefully.

To start with, make sure you're running [DOCKER VERSION 19.03.13].
You'll need to run rabbit MQ with the following command:

[  docker run -it --rm --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3-management  ]

With RabbitMQ running, open the docker control panel and open the website attached to RabbitMQ, or, using your browser of choice, open 
[   http://localhost:15672/   ]
the default username and password are
[   guest    ]
[   guest    ]

From the overview screen, navigate to the "Admin" tab, and scroll down to the "Add a user" section.
For safety sake, we'll list all the users made during our creation of this assignment:
[   Tom    ] 			usrname
[   12345    ]			password

[   simpleUser   ]		usrname
[   12345     ]			password

[   a   ]			usrname
[   a   ]			password

With the users added, now it't time to add a virtual host! Thankfully there's only one this time:
Using the sidebar titles "Virtual Hosts" under the "Admin" tab -- same as the user creation screen -- we'll need to "Add a new virtual host"
the name has to be:
[   SimpleVirtHost   ]		virtual host name

but the desctiption and tags can be anything you like :D

Wit hboth users & VirtualHost set up, the final step before running the assignment builds is to give permissions to the Users, so they 
may access the VirtualHost
For each user under the "Admin" -> "Users" tab, click the name in the left most channel -- "Name"
This should take you to an overview page, where we can add virtual hosts using the dropdown menu.
Click the 
[   SimpleVirtHost   ]		permission VHost needed
option, then "set permission".

This should manage all the permissions needed for the assignment builds; some of them use automated logins to save the user valuable time.

Run the .exe in the [Part 1] folder first; you'll see more that way.
